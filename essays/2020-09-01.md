Since I was 5 years old, I had a fascination for technology. Time and time I would find myself wondering what allows me to play these fun video games on my handheld game boy. As I grew up my interest in games had me experience many different types of machines. My hobby for building computers came when I was in middle school, where my home computer; old e-machine broke down and prevented me from playing games and surfing the web. I did my research and constructed my own computer off of parts I bought online, it was a budget build, total came out to around $340. Since then, I knew I wanted to work in IT. Heading into college I attempted to pursue a degree in Information & Computer Science. I later changed to MIS because of my part time job working at UH Manoa's IT center. I realized I wanted to also work with people, perform in a business setting. While these things can be achieved still with a ICS major, I ultimately decided that MIS will fit me better.
